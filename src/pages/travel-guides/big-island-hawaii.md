| <mark>Mauna Kea</mark>              | Hilo    | The drive to the summit of Mauna Kea can be challenging. Four-wheel drive vehicles are required above the Visitor Information Station located at the 9,000 ft. level. Go shortly before sunset to be next to the telescopes when the sun is still up then you can watch the sun go down. The altitude is high so if you are planning to scuba dive, there needs to be 24 hours of spacing. |
| <mark>Waipi'o On Hourseback</mark>  | Honokaa | It’s hard to drive down to the valley so we went on a horseback riding tour. They drive you down as well!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Waipi'o Valley Lookout              | Honokaa | Easy access. You can just park and go to the lookout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Zipline @<mark>Umauma Falls</mark>  | Honomu  | Zipline through multiple waterfalls. It was fun!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <mark>Volcano National Park</mark>  | Volcano | It’s fun hiking inside the craters. There wasn’t any active lava flow when we went but if you’re lucky, you might be able to see them! We spent 2.5 hours hiking to Halamaumau crater.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| <mark>Akaka Falls State Park</mark> | Honomu  | Paved, very easy walk to be done under 30 mins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Onomea Bay Trail                    | Hilo    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| <mark>Kaumana Caves</mark>          | Hilo    | Take a walk inside of a lava tube cave. Wear good shoes since you’d be climbing rocks sometimes. Strong flashlight is recommended but you can use your phone if you’re not going too deep in.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| <mark>Swim with Manta Ray</mark>                     | Kona | Such an amazing experience. Book a tour and they’d take you out to the water at night and you can float and get close contact with manta rays (one of them touched my feet!) |

| Hike @<mark>Pololu Valley</mark> | Hawi | A little hike to the beach at the bottom. The view was beautiful!                                          |
| Skydiving @Big Island Gravity    | Hawi | They’re not particularly organized (lost our skydiving footage) and don’t take all the safety precautions. |

| <mark>Tex Drive-In</mark>       | Honokaa | Bavarian creme malasadas or any malasadas              | We like the bavarian creme the best. I Love the jam and apple and strawberry filling too. They sometimes have guava or haupia earlier. Two malasadas was enough for a meal.                                                     |
| <mark>Two Ladies Kitchen</mark> | Hilo    | Mochi (red bean with strawberry)                       | Wamea's KTA sometimes carries them but the selection was limited. If you're interested, go in person                                                                                                                            |
| Mr. Ed's Bakery                 | Hilo    | Any jam - they have 100+ flavors                       | Right next to the Akaka waterfall. We sampled around 15 flavors. I got lilikoi jam at the end.                                                                                                                                  |
| Ken's House of Pancakes         | Hilo    | Any pancake - love their lilikoi and boysenberry syrup | I got the macademia-nut pancake. The pancake was nice but I especially liked their syrups. There were four options, maple, coconut, lilikoi, and boysenberry syrup. Don't get the char siu - too sweet and dry. Saimin is okay. |
