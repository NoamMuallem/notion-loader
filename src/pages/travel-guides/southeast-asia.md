## Thailand

### Trivikram’s recs

- Recommend Penang. I've only been to Pattaya and love it. Primarily eating seafood and relaxing on the beach. They have some action sports too, I'd tried bungy jumping. There's nothing much in Bangkok AFAIK, but it's just 2 hours drive, so you can cover that too if you have time. Since you're a couple, I recommend flying to Phuket.

### Pattaya (3 days)

- Day 3
  - Nong Nooch Garden - 500-acre botanical garden in the Nong Nooch Village
    - lake, orchid nurseries, and waterfalls
    - Elephant shows, Thai boxing, sword fighting, and folk dances are some of the many shows that can be attended in the village
  - [Pattaya Floating Market](https://www.trazy.com/experience/detail/3757?ch=0001&label=3-days-in-pattaya&link_id=4965) - split into four different sections, each representing and selling items from four different regions of Thailand (North, Northeast, Central, and South). Here you can find many eateries, fruit stalls, souvenir shops, as well as several art galleries (already doing it in Chiang Mai)

  - Thalang Road is a busy hub with great shops and where the weekly Sunday Walking Street Market takes place.

The best part about these viewpoints is that not a whole lot of people know about them so you will likely be the only one there.

### Rosie & Veronica’s recs

- Spend weekdays in a major city and travel through smaller more rural places during the weekends. Probably make your way south to north through the country

## Malaysia

### Trivikram’s recs

I'd only been to Kaula Lumpur and Genting Highlands. Nothing memorable from my trip.

## Singapore

### Trivikram’s recs

Best thing I liked: food and the futuristic city designs. \
Thing I didn't like: heat and cost.

Spend time in Singapore just as a tourist (say 3-4 days). For WFH, Thailand/Phillipines are way too cheap.

My recommendations for your three weeks (23 days) in Nov:

- 10 days: Thailand (4 days Chiang Mai, 3 days Pattaya, 3 days Phuket)
- 3 days: Singapore
- 10 days: Phillipines (5 days Cebu, 5 days Palawan)
